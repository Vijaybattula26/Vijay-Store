- Store data (products, categories, cart, wishlist, orders, customer, settings) lives in localStorage via the repositories in `src/lib/db.ts`; pure rules live in `src/lib/commerce.ts` (tested in `src/test/commerce.test.ts`). Why: the owner asked for a backend-free demo that can later swap to a real database without UI changes.
- Admin under `/admin` is a device-local demo passcode gate (`ssr: false`), not real security. Why: no backend auth exists yet; replace before launch.
